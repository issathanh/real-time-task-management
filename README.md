# real-time-task-management

Detailed Development Plan
The project is broken into phases to manage complexity and focus learning. Each phase includes front-end, back-end, and database tasks, with estimated timeframes for an intermediate learner.

Phase 1: Setup and Basic UI (2–3 Weeks)
Goal: Build a local web app with basic task management (no backend yet).

Front End (React):
Set up a React project using Create React App or Vite.
Create components:
TaskList: Display tasks (title, status, due date).
TaskForm: Form to create/edit tasks (title, description, due date, priority).
NavBar: Navigation for task list and task creation.
Use React Router for navigation between task list and task creation pages.
Manage tasks in local state (useState or useReducer) or localStorage for persistence.
Add basic styling with CSS or a library like Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap.
Implement simple animations (e.g., fade-in for new tasks) using CSS or Framer Motion.
Database (Local):
Use localStorage or a JSON file to simulate a database for tasks.
Structure data: { id, title, description, dueDate, isCompleted, priority }.
Learning Outcomes:
React: Components, hooks (useState, useEffect), routing.
UI: Responsive design, basic animations, styling.
State: Local state management, persistence with localStorage.
Tools: Node.js, React, Vite/Create React App, Tailwind CSS (optional), Visual Studio Code.
Time: 15–20 hours.
Phase 2: Backend Setup and Authentication (2–3 Weeks)
Goal: Set up a FastAPI backend with user authentication and task APIs.

Back End (FastAPI):
Set up a FastAPI project with Python (use pip install fastapi uvicorn).
Configure PostgreSQL (local instance or cloud provider like Render).
Create models with an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM):
User: id, email, password (hashed), name.
Task: id, title, description, dueDate, isCompleted, userId.
Implement authentication:
Use JWT for email/password login or integrate OAuth (e.g., Google via python-social-auth).
Create endpoints: POST /signup, POST /login, GET /me (protected).
Build REST APIs:
POST /tasks: Create a task.
GET /tasks: List user’s tasks.
PUT /tasks/:id: Update a task.
DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task.
Secure APIs with JWT middleware to ensure only authenticated users access their tasks.
Database (PostgreSQL):
Design schema: users (id, email, password, name), tasks (id, title, description, dueDate, isCompleted, userId).
Create tables using migrations (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy).
Test database with a tool like pgAdmin or DBeaver.
Front End (React):
Add a login/signup page with forms for email/password or OAuth buttons.
Use Axios or Fetch to call FastAPI endpoints for authentication and tasks.
Store JWT in localStorage or cookies for session management.
Update the task list to fetch data from the backend instead of localStorage.
Handle API errors (e.g., show “Failed to load tasks” messages).
Learning Outcomes:
FastAPI: Building APIs, async Python, middleware.
PostgreSQL: Schema design, migrations, basic queries.
Authentication: JWT, OAuth, secure session management.
React: API integration, error handling, authentication flows.
Tools: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy/Tortoise ORM, JWT, Axios, Postman.
Time: 20–25 hours.
Phase 3: Collaboration and Real-Time Updates (3–4 Weeks)
Goal: Add project-based collaboration and real-time updates via WebSockets.

Back End (FastAPI):
Add models: Project (id, name, ownerId), ProjectUser (projectId, userId).
Update Task model to include projectId.
Create APIs:
POST /projects: Create a project.
POST /projects/:id/invite: Invite a user (by email or userId).
GET /projects: List user’s projects.
Implement WebSockets in FastAPI:
Create a WebSocket endpoint (e.g., /ws).
Broadcast task updates (create, update, delete) to project collaborators.
Use a channel system (e.g., Redis or in-memory) to send updates to relevant users.
Query tasks by project and collaborators.
Database (PostgreSQL):
Add projects and project_users tables.
Update migrations for new tables and relationships.
Write queries to fetch tasks by project or collaborator.
Front End (React):
Add a project list page and project creation form.
Implement an invite system (e.g., input field for email, call invite API).
Integrate WebSocket client (use ws library or Socket.IO).
Connect to FastAPI’s WebSocket endpoint.
Update task list in real time based on WebSocket messages.
Display collaboration updates (e.g., “User X completed Task Y”).
Learning Outcomes:
WebSockets: Real-time communication, event handling.
Database: Many-to-many relationships, complex queries.
React: Real-time UI updates, WebSocket integration.
FastAPI: WebSocket endpoints, broadcasting events.
Tools: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, WebSocket (ws or Socket.IO), React.
Time: 25–30 hours.
Phase 4: Notifications and Polish (2–3 Weeks)
Goal: Add browser notifications, analytics, and polish for deployment.

Back End (FastAPI):
Implement Web Push API for browser notifications:
Use pywebpush to send push notifications when tasks are updated.
Store user notification subscriptions in PostgreSQL.
Add an endpoint to register notification subscriptions.
Front End (React):
Request notification permissions using the browser’s Notification API.
Register the subscription with the backend.
Handle incoming notifications (e.g., display task updates).
Add polish:
Animations (e.g., task completion transitions) using Framer Motion.
Error handling (e.g., network errors, invalid inputs).
Responsive design for mobile and desktop browsers.
Analytics (Optional):
Integrate Google Analytics for tracking task creation, completion, and collaboration.
Alternatively, log events in FastAPI (e.g., store task completion counts in PostgreSQL).
Testing and Deployment:
Test APIs with Postman and WebSockets with a tool like wscat.
Test the app in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
Deploy the backend to Heroku or Render.
Deploy the React front end to Vercel or Netlify.
Learning Outcomes:
Web Push API: Browser notifications, subscription management.
React: Advanced UI polish, responsive design.
Deployment: Hosting front and back end, configuring production environments.
Analytics: Tracking user behavior, custom metrics.
Tools: pywebpush, Google Analytics, Heroku/Render, Vercel/Netlify, Postman, wscat.
Time: 15–20 hours.
